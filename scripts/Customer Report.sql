Customer Report
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
    2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
       - Total orders
       - Total sales
       - Total quantity purchased
       - Distinct products bought
       - Lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
       - Recency (months since last order)
       - Average order value (AOV)
       - Average monthly spend
